# H2L - microframework

Get started quickly with static pages and small apis

## Requirements

 + PHP 7


## Install

 + Install via composer: `composer require alkemann/h2l`
 + While you can use the library as only a lib, it comes with an index.php file.
   The library comes with 3 skeletons to get you started, the "min" contains basically
   just the index.php, the minimum expected folder structure and a hello world base route.
   You can also use the "base" that contains a an app, some base css, config files.
   Thirdly there is an "example" version that contains some more illustative example pages
   and dynamic routes. install by simply copying the skeleton folder contents of choice down
   to the root of your app (presumably the same folder that contains the "vendor" composer):
   `vendor/bin/h2l skeleton base`
