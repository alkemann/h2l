# H2L - microframework

Welcome to H2L a micro framework for PHP 7.1+

## Guide : Static pages

They dont really have to be static though, full PHP support is included. But to add a `route` to a page, simply
add the file in the folder you want under `/content/pages` in order to create the URL you want.
