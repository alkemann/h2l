# Skeletons

*Skeletons* are blank application start points where the infrastructure has been set up. These range from basic boostrap
with an `index.php` all the way to a full application structure with Heroku and frontend Node transpilation set up. You
can use any one of these or start from scratch with your own or use these libraries as standalone tools.

## Install

After having installed *alkemann/h2l* with composer you may "install" the skeleton by copying the files and folders to the
root of your project. A script has been included for you in `vendor/bin` that you may use for this:

<pre>
$ <kbd>vendor/bin/skeleton <var>name</var></kbd>
</pre>
